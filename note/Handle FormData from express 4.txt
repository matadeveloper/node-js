Ref : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37630419/how-to-handle-formdata-from-express-4

body-parser doesn't handle multipart bodies, which is what FormData is submitted as.

Instead, use a module like multer.

For example, to retrieve the (regular) fields of a request:

const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer();

app.post('/send', upload.none(), (req, res) => {
  const formData = req.body;
  console.log('form data', formData);
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
